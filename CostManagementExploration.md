I explored the cost management features offered by both Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Both platforms provide extensive tools that help to monitor, manage, and optimize cloud spending, which are important for keeping cloud expenses under control.

1. Cost Management in Azure,
Azure Cost Management Dashboard

Description: The Azure Cost Management dashboard offers a view of your cloud spending. You can view current and forecasted costs, set budgets, and monitor spending trends. 
Setting Budgets and Alerts in Azure

Azure's budget and alert system allows users to create budgets for specific resources or subscriptions. You can create a spending threshold and create alerts to notify you when spending approaches or exceeds the budgeted amount. This is a helpful tool for cost control and avoiding unexpected expenses.

Key Features Found in Azure:
Cost Analysis: Detailed breakdown of costs across different resources and services.
Forecasting: Predictions based on current usage patterns to anticipate future spending.
Exporting Data: Ability to export cost data for further analysis.
Budgets and Alerts: Highly customizable budgets that trigger alerts when thresholds are met.

2. Cost Management in GCP,
GCP Billing Dashboard

Description: The GCP Billing Dashboard provides a real-time view of your Google Cloud spending. It includes tools to monitor current costs, track spending history, and forecast future expenses. The interface is clear and easy to navigate and offers insights into resource utilization.

Setting Budgets and Alerts in GCP. GCP's budget and alert system is similar to Azureâ€™s, allowing you to set budgets based on specific projects or services. You can create custom alerts to notify you when spending approaches or exceeds a certain amount, helping to manage costs more effectively.

Key Features Found in GCP:
Cost Breakdown: showing how much each service or resource contributes to the total bill.
Budgets and Alerts: Ability to set budgets for projects and services with alerts.
Reports: Generate custom reports based on spending patterns.
Recommendations: GCP provides recommendations to optimize spending, such as identifying unused resources.

Below I have attached screen shots of the dashboards I explored and the hypothetical budgets and alerts created in Azure and GCP.
